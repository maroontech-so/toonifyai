## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(48, 100%, 50%) - RGB(255, 204, 0). A vibrant yellow to evoke a playful and creative mood, mirroring the artistic nature of the app.
- Background color: HSL(48, 20%, 95%) - RGB(247, 244, 230). A very light, desaturated yellow, provides a bright but unobtrusive background that lets the artwork pop.
- Accent color: HSL(78, 68%, 47%) - RGB(119, 196, 37).  A contrasting vivid green that draws attention to key interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines and short UI text to maintain a geometric, contemporary look; 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text because of its balance between modern and warmth.
- Use flat, vector-based icons that are simple and easily recognizable.
- Use a grid-based layout to ensure consistent spacing and alignment.
- Subtle transition animations when switching between images and applying effects to give the app a modern feel.
